Burning Down The House
=======================
Burning Down the House(BDH) is an app to randomize and speed up the set up of the Flashpoint board game.  Side note- If you have not played, you must.

The worst part of the game is setting up the board for play. The idea of BDH, is to collect the number of players and difficulty level, and then randomly assign the various components required to setup the game.

This is the project I work on in my free time, so it does not get as much love, as it deserves.
